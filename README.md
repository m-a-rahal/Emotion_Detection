## MobileNet pretrained on AffectNet model
The default model included in this repository is a modified version of Savchenko et al. [MobileNet model](https://github.com/HSE-asavchenko/face-emotion-recognition/blob/main/models/affectnet_emotions/mobilenet_7.h5) pretrained on [AffectNet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/).
